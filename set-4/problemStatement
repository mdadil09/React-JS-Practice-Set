1. Given an array of characters, build a Tab component in React that shows the name of characters on click of two buttons, one for heroes and other for villains. On click of “Show Heroes” button, a list of heroes should be displayed and on click of “Show Villains” button, a list of villains should be displayed on the DOM. Use useState Hook.
